# Attendence-using-LBPH
Description
This project aims to create an automated attendance system using LBPH facial recognition. The system captures images of individuals, detects faces, and recognizes them using LBPH algorithm. The attendance is then recorded based on the recognized faces.

Features
Face detection and recognition using LBPH algorithm.
Database management for storing face encodings and attendance records.
GUI for user interaction and system control.
Automatic attendance recording and reporting.
Technologies Used
Python for programming.
OpenCV for image processing and LBPH facial recognition.
SQLite for database management.
Tkinter for GUI development.
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-system-lbph.git
Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main.py script to start the attendance system.
Use the GUI to add new faces to the database and start the attendance recording.
View attendance records and reports using the GUI interface.
